## FAQ

### How can I get the Bot on my Server?
Currently there is no way to get this bot on your own server.
This will change at a later point in time.

### How do I make an Feature Request?
Open an Issue and it will be reviewed.
Don't request something thats already requested,
add to the exiting request.

### How do I report a Bug?
Look through the open bugs and look if it already exists and add there.
If there is no open bug yet, open an Issue.
Please describe the scenario as precise as possible.
Feel free to attach a copy of the chat.

### Can I donate?
Maybe in the future, when this Project grows,
as long as it's just serving one server it isn't worth it.
